title: "Function Parameters as References"
description: "The result of this scheme is that a function may change any mutable object passed as a parameter, but it cannot
change the identity of those objects (i.e., it cannot altogether replace an object with another). 
Example shows a simple function using += on one of its parameters. As we pass numbers, lists, and tuples to the function, the actual
arguments passed are affected in different ways."

### [Python] Function Parameters as References

```python
def f(p1, p2):
    p1 += p2
    return p1

x, y = 1, 2
f(x, y)
# x = 1, y = 2

a = [1, 2]
b = [3, 4]
f(a, b)
# a 的值改变了
# a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# b = [3, 4]

m = (1, 2)
n = (3, 4)
f(m, n)
# m = (1, 2)
# n = (3, 4)
```
